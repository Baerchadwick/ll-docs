Nicholas Cage is the single greatest character actor this generation has ever seen.
In this essay I will outline 3 specific examples to support this hypothesis.

1. Face/Off

  This is all the evidence I will provide and I think that it speaks for itself.

2. Con Air

  "Put the bunneh down."

  These are the words that shaped a generation. World famous character actor __Nicholas Cage__, years ahead of his time, takes on the systematic oppression of for profit prisons and the lack of progress of prison reform that was taking place during the Clinton administration.

  Arguably one of the most challenging roles he's portrayed, Cage plays a compassionate champion. of the innocent, jailed for protecting the woman he loves. Representing the ethical standards that should protect prisoners and encourage reform, he takes on __John Malkovich__, who portrays the villainous _Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom_.

  The brutality that Grissom invokes is representative of the violence and oppression prisoners face when jailed in the for-profit prison system. Cage's performance is a commentary on how even good people can be changed when they must endure and survive in such conditions.
